# 🗓️ CalendarFi - Real Google Calendar Integration

## 🎯 What's New

CalendarFi now has **REAL Google Calendar integration**! This means:

✅ **Read from Google Calendar** - Fetch your existing events
✅ **Write to Google Calendar** - Create events from the app
✅ **Automatic Updates** - Transaction status updates in calendar
✅ **Real Blockchain** - Execute actual Solana transactions
✅ **Full Sync** - Everything syncs between app and calendar

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (30 minutes)

### Step 1: Google Calendar Setup
Follow: `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_SETUP.md`

**What you'll do:**
- Create Google Cloud Project
- Enable Calendar API
- Create Service Account
- Download JSON key
- Create Google Calendar
- Share with service account

**Result:** `backend/service-account-key.json` + Calendar ID

### Step 2: Start Servers
```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend
cd /Users/anantkumar/Desktop/earn/backend
node server.js

# Terminal 2: Frontend
cd /Users/anantkumar/Desktop/earn/calendefi-new
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test
Follow: `FULL_SETUP_GUIDE.md`

**What you'll do:**
- Onboard calendar
- Create event
- Execute transaction
- Verify in Google Calendar
- Check Solana Explorer

## 🔄 How It Works

### 1. User Onboards Calendar
```
User enters calendar ID
    ↓
Backend verifies access
    ↓
Calendar stored in system
    ↓
Ready to create events
```

### 2. User Creates Event
```
User fills event form
    ↓
App sends to backend
    ↓
Backend creates in Google Calendar
    ↓
Event appears in app & calendar
```

### 3. User Executes Transaction
```
User clicks "Execute"
    ↓
Backend parses event title
    ↓
Creates Solana transaction
    ↓
Signs with calendar wallet
    ↓
Sends to blockchain
    ↓
Updates calendar event with signature
    ↓
User sees status: "executed"
```

### 4. Verification

## 📊 API Endpoints

### Calendar API
```
GET  /api/calendar/events?calendarId=...
     → Fetch upcoming events

POST /api/calendar/create-event
     → Create new event

POST /api/calendar/onboard
     → Onboard calendar

GET  /api/calendar/service-account
     → Get service account email
```

### Transaction API
```
POST /api/transaction/execute
     → Execute transaction from event

GET  /api/transaction/status/:eventId
     → Get transaction status

GET  /api/wallet/:calendarId
     → Get wallet info
```

## 🔐 Security

### Service Account Key
- Stored locally in `backend/service-account-key.json`
- Never exposed to frontend
- Only used for Google Calendar API
- Keep this file safe!

### Wallet Generation
- Deterministic from calendar ID
- No private keys stored
- Derived on-the-fly for transactions
- Secure and reproducible

### Transactions
- Signed locally on backend
- Sent to Solana network
- Confirmed before updating calendar
- Immutable on blockchain

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Simple Transfer
```
Event: "Send 0.1 SOL to 9B5X4z6G8H2K1L3M5N7P9Q1R3S5T7V9X"
Result: 0.1 SOL transferred, calendar updated
```

### Scenario 2: Multiple Transfers
```
Event 1: "Send 0.05 SOL to address1"
Event 2: "Send 0.05 SOL to address2"
Result: Both executed, both in calendar
```

### Scenario 3: Error Handling
```
Event: "Send 1000 SOL to address"
Result: Insufficient balance error, status: failed
```

### Scenario 4: Calendar Sync
```
Create event in app
    ↓
Execute transaction
    ↓
Check Google Calendar
    ↓
See event with signature
```
