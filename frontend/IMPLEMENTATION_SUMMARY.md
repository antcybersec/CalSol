## 🔧 Files Modified

### Backend Server
**File:** `backend/server.js`

**Changes:**
1. Added Google Calendar API initialization
2. Added new endpoints:
   - `GET /api/calendar/events` - Fetch calendar events
   - `POST /api/calendar/create-event` - Create events
   - `POST /api/calendar/onboard` - Onboard calendar with verification
3. Updated transaction execution to update calendar events
4. Integrated calendarService

### Frontend Dashboard
**File:** `calendefi-new/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`

**Changes:**
1. Added `fetchCalendarEvents()` function
2. Updated `handleOnboardCalendar()` to fetch events after onboarding
3. Updated `handleAddEvent()` to create events in Google Calendar
4. Added error handling for calendar operations

---

## 🔌 New API Endpoints

### Calendar Endpoints
```
GET /api/calendar/events?calendarId=...
    Response: { success, data: { calendarId, events } }

POST /api/calendar/create-event
    Body: { calendarId, title, description, startTime, endTime }
    Response: { success, data: { eventId, title, start, end } }

POST /api/calendar/onboard
    Body: { calendarId }
    Response: { success, message, calendarId }
    Note: Now verifies calendar access!

GET /api/calendar/service-account
    Response: { email: "agent@calendefi.iam.gserviceaccount.com" }
```

### Updated Endpoints
```
POST /api/transaction/execute
    Now updates calendar event with transaction status
    Updates description with signature and explorer link
```

## 🔐 Configuration

### Environment Variables
**File:** `backend/.env`

```env
PORT=3001
SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID=your-calendar-id@group.calendar.google.com
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH=./service-account-key.json
```

### Service Account Key
**File:** `backend/service-account-key.json` (NEW)

- Downloaded from Google Cloud Console
- Contains authentication credentials
- Used to access Google Calendar API
- **Keep this file safe!**

## 🔄 Data Flow

### Onboarding Flow
```
User enters calendar ID
    ↓
Frontend sends to backend
    ↓
Backend verifies access via Google Calendar API
    ↓
Backend stores calendar ID
    ↓
Frontend fetches upcoming events
    ↓
Events displayed in dashboard
```

### Event Creation Flow
```
User fills event form
    ↓
Frontend sends to backend
    ↓
Backend creates event in Google Calendar
    ↓
Backend returns event ID
    ↓
Frontend adds to local state
    ↓
Event appears in dashboard
```

### Transaction Execution Flow
```
User clicks "Execute"
    ↓
Frontend sends to backend
    ↓
Backend parses event title
    ↓
Backend creates Solana transaction
    ↓
Backend signs with calendar wallet
    ↓
Backend sends to blockchain
    ↓
Backend updates calendar event with signature
    ↓
Frontend updates status to "executed"
    ↓
User sees signature and explorer link
```

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Calendar Onboarding
```
Input: Valid calendar ID
Expected: Calendar verified, events fetched
Result: ✅ Events appear in dashboard
```

### Scenario 2: Event Creation
```
Input: Event title, date, time
Expected: Event created in Google Calendar
Result: ✅ Event appears in app and calendar
```

### Scenario 3: Transaction Execution
```
Input: "Send 0.1 SOL to address"
Expected: Transaction executed, calendar updated
Result: ✅ Signature in calendar, on explorer
```

### Scenario 4: Error Handling
```
Input: Invalid calendar ID
Expected: Error message
Result: ✅ User sees error, can retry
```

## 🔐 Security Features

### Service Account Authentication
- Uses Google Cloud service account
- JSON key stored locally
- Never exposed to frontend
- Only used for Google Calendar API

### Wallet Security
- Deterministic generation from calendar ID
- No private keys stored in database
- Derived on-the-fly for transactions
- Secure and reproducible

### Transaction Security
- Signed locally on backend
- Sent to Solana network
- Confirmed before updating calendar
- Immutable on blockchain
